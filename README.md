Tooling for group self-awareness on holochain

##  Background

Groups, especially remote colaborative groups, often lack contextual information about collaborators that makes working together harder.  Co-locating oneself across a number of spaces in the context of a group (or groups) provides an important avenue for improving both sense-making and working together.  **Where** provides a generalized pattern for creating shared maps for groups to see the emergent "whereness" of each other across self-evolved sets of maps.

## Design

For more details read the [design documents](DESIGN.md).

## Installation

1. Install the holochain dev environment: https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/holochain/where && cd ./where`
3. Enter the nix shell: `nix-shell`

## Building the DNA

- Build the DNA (assumes you are still in the nix shell for correct rust/cargo versions from step above):
  - Assemble the DNA:

```bash
npm run build:happ
```

### Running the DNA tests
```bash
npm run test
```

## UI

To test out the UI:

``` bash
npm run start
```

## Package

To package the web happ:

``` bash
npm run package
```

You'll have the `where.happ` in `dna/workdir/happ`, and `ui.zip` in `ui/apps/where`.
